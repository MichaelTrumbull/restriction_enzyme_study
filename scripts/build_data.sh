# run splitting script to split each sequence in fasta files into two (sequences are too long to fit in esm1b)


# run esm script to generate esm1b inferences from bulk fasta files


# build input data tensor by taking the individual .pt files for each sequence, 
# pushing them together, padding, and flattening them.


# build target data using a psuedo one hot method


# remove temporary files
