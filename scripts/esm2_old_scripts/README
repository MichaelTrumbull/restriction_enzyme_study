scripts in this directory needed to be rewritten. Training was successful and the loss was improved but there are areas that these scripts were lacking.
1. Target data was redundant as it represented BOTH sides of the DNA sequence it was targeting.
2. cross entropy was misimplemented. It needed to be applied to each individual bit, NOT each 4bit.
3. as I look at new networks it will get messy so I need to separate files for organization reasons.
4. need to clean up the file. It has gotten messy while I rapidly tried new ideas.
Don't use the scripts in this directory.
